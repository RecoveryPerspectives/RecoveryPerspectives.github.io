        <p>I am not totally without credentials for writing about emotional growth in adults or even depression, anxiety and chronic stress. After all, I have a Master’s Degree in Social Work, a thirty year career in various different areas of social work and a few years during which my primary responsibility was mental health counseling. As a supervisor in treatment foster care agencies, a case manager and a mental health counselor I noticed how indifferent most clients were towards their medications. Very few thought they received any therapeutic benefits from them. Many took them simply to satisfy agency requirements. Others terminated their relationship with the agency to avoid the side effects of their prescribed medications.</p>
		<p>I started to ask myself, <i>“Can’t we do better than this?”</i> This simple question led me on a venture to learn what I could about non-medical approaches to mental health. The exciting part of this venture was when I realized that the established truism that mental illnesses are just like physical illness was indefensible. I spent a decade or so reading and writing about these matters. I continued into retirement, wasting vast amounts of my retirement following false leads and trying to create web sites. On more than one occasion I quit out of frustration and disgust. All my mental health friends thought that was a good choice. But, in spite of the lack of support (or perhaps because of it) I kept returning to my project.</p>
		<p>Readers who insist that their preferred theory is <i>“evidence-based”</i> or that depression is a real disease will object to my approach. I don’t mind; emotional growth is not for everyone. However, it is for people like the one I read about in today’s Columbus Dispatch (9/3/2020). A woman, despairing about the upheaval in her world, is quoted as saying, <i>“I need someone to help me get the tools to cope.”</i> I don’t doubt that she does but my goal is to encourage people like her to find resources within themselves, to learn to <i>“think developmentally.”</i>  </p>
		<p>I believe the skills involved in emotional growth are critically important to your personal well-being but also to our community health.</p>
