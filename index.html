              Synopsis
            </h3>
			
		</div>
			<p>Simply put, emotional growth views troubling feelings like depression, anxiety and chronic stress as consequences, not symptoms. The difference is between viewing unwanted feelings as interpretations of difficult experiences, and hence as consequences, or as caused by biological defects, and hence as symptoms of those causes. This website explores this distinction and its implications for mental health. The synopsis below is a start.</p>
			</a>
			<ol>
			<li><b>Troubling feelings are a normal part of life.</b> They convey messages about your outlook or perspective on life and perspective reflects the emotional issues you struggle with. </li>
			<li><b>We all lose perspective from time to time:</b> we feel we can’t let go of the past, we can’t manage the future or we lose sight of our goals. When the past, the future and the present are thus distorted we lose hope, confidence and focus respectively. </li>
			<li><b>Our mental health depends on our capacity to restore perspective</b>, to “let go,” to be more assertive and to stay focused during times of transition (which is more often than you think.) </li>
			<li><b>Certain skills restore perspective.</b> They are familiar skills you probably already possess although you might not realize how they can be used to combat depression, anxiety and chronic stress.</li>
			<li><b>We all participate in the development of our emotional issues.</b> This might make you uncomfortable but unless you confront this fact you won’t be able to take effective steps to manage your issues.</li>
			<li><b>“Thinking developmentally,” as described above, outlines a process for taking charge of your emotional life.</b> It is essentially a framework for replacing troubling feelings with productive ones and perhaps, in the process, discovering hope, confidence and peace of mind.</li>
			</ol>

                                    <p>The framework for emotional growth provides a nonmedical understanding of mental health.  It asserts that troubling feelings are windows, not symptoms. As windows, they reveal our interpretations of experience, our personal perspectives, not biological or cognitive defects. Their role is to help us identify issues, select goals and adopt strategies for change. Of course, none of this works if we don’t attend to and take responsibility for our feelings. Our troubling feelings, in short, do not just happen to us as suggested by the Medical Model. We are active participants in their formation. </p>
                                    <p>A working definition of emotional growth might be stated as follows: Do you:</p>
									<ol class="list-inline item-details">
									<b>
									<li>1. Know how to make sense of your depressive, anxious and stressful feelings?</li>
									<li>2. Have some long term goal?</li>
									<li>3. Have the skills you need to achieve your goals?</li>
									<li>4. Have a back-up plan in case your original plan is blocked?</li>
									<li>5. Know how to accept the benefits of emotional growth?</li>
									</b>
									</ol>
									<p>If you answer in the affirmative to these questions, even if your responses are tentative, you already know a great deal about emotional growth. You know that it doesn’t require special credentials; it is available to ordinary folks. As such, it puts our struggles into a human context. It recognizes that troubling feelings are part of life, that issues with depression, anxiety and chronic stress are consequences, and that since we don’t control the world around us the best we can do is manage the world within us. <i>Emotional issues like depression, anxiety and chronic stress are a loss of perspective on our experiences and recovery is the process of restoring perspective.</i></p>
                                    <p><b>Why does all this matter?</b> Because in order to survive in the upheaval that is the current world ordinary, untrained people need to know that they are competent to understand their unwanted feelings.  We must give up the notion that experts have special insight into our emotional life and realize that God means for us to struggle so that we can more fully appreciate His creation.</p>
