		<p>I believe mental health is something you do, not something provided to you, that people who attend to their troubling feelings understand their messages and that relief from those feelings comes through translating those messages into action plans. We struggle with unwanted feelings, not because we are weak but because we are human. It is our great good fortune to have the capacity to learn from and even benefit from our struggles. Emotional growth is the process of struggling purposefully.</p>
		<p>There is nothing technical or mysterious about emotional growth. It starts as every day encounters with sensations we aren’t always fully aware of it. It might be a tugging sensation at the edge of your consciousness that takes the form of muscle tension, a churning sensation in your stomach, a headache or throbbing in your chest. These sensations grow and subside all the time but it is when they grow that they demand our attention.</p>
		<p>Attending to these unwanted feelings is just a fancy word for <i>“makings sense of.”</i> You make sense of troubling feelings when you notice how they alter your thinking. Some turn your thoughts to the past, to what has already happened and cannot be changed. Others turn your thoughts to the future, to what might happen but are out of your control. Still others turn your thoughts to present circumstances, to some transitions that has disrupted your comfort zone. We can learn skills that improve our capacity to attend.</p>
		<p>Attending, then, refers to how we process difficult experiences. However, making sense of troubling feelings doesn’t eliminate them; it only helps us understand how they fit in with the rest of our life. It spares us the inconvenience of fixing things that aren’t broken but it is only a first step towards fixing what is broken.</p>
		<p>Describing emotional growth is easy. If you know what’s broken you can select a goal to fix the problem. That means you need an action plan which usually involves learning and adopting new skills. After that, you need to apply your action plan in an uncooperative world. The hard part of emotional growth is in selecting goals, implementing action plans and adjusting it to the obstacles you invariable encounter.</p>
		<p>This web site takes a closer look at growing emotionally.</p>

          <p>I believe mental health is something you do, not something provided to you, that people who confront
their troubling feelings need to understand those feelings as warnings, not symptoms and that relief
from those feelings comes from skills, not pills.</p>
<p> It is our misfortune that, as humans, we struggle so
much with unwanted feelings but it is our great good fortune to have access to resources that allow us
to learn from and even benefit from our struggles.</p>
          <h2 class="section-heading">Thinking Developmentally</h2>

          <p>At the center of human life is the struggle with unwanted feelings. It is ironic that these feelings erode
the quality of life for so many people and yet are the source of emotional growth for a great many
others. </p>

          </a>
<p>It seems that troubling feelings aren’t the problem so much as how we interpret them is. We
need to have a frame of reference that explains this basic reality. Thinking developmentally is a good
place to start.</p>

          <p>or more text</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Acting Purposefully</h2>

          <p>Troubling feelings convey messages that are windows on your issues. To deal with those issues you need to translate messages into purposes and purposes into action plans. The purposes you select reflect your perspective on the past, the future or the present that is, on your capacity to let go of losses, become assertive with your challenges and stay focused on your goals respectively.</p>

		  <h2 class="section-heading">The Consequences of Restoring Perspective</h2>

          <p>Emotional growth is the consequence of restoring perspective. But life is not that simple. First, you have to sustain your growth over time in a world that is pretty much indifferent to your action plan. Then you have to identify benefits when you encounter them and finally you have to decide if you want to accept the risks those benefits present.</p>
		  
		  
		   <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion</h2>
		   <p>Thinking developmentally, I understand that</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled">
        <ul>
            <li>Troubling feelings are a normal part of life, </li>
            <li>Their messages reflect my issues,</li>
			<li>Resolving those issues requires purpose and an action plan designed to restores the only thing I can change: my perspective. </li>
        </ul>

</ul>

<p>I can select goals that match my perspective, adopt strategies that meet my goals and sustain the
progress I achieve. Depending on my perspective I can replace (perhaps with the support and guidance
of people who care about me) depressive, anxious and stressful feelings with productive feelings. As I
restore perspective I can learn from my past struggles.</p>

          <p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

          <p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
